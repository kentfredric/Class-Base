* I think things like debug() and debugging() should be part of a 
  Class::Base::Debug mixin, but for now they're in here.

* Other mixins might include Class::Base::Factory for providing 
  factory() and create() methods which interface to uhm, Class::Factory,
  oh, I see Chris Winters has already written that, oh good... hmmm...
